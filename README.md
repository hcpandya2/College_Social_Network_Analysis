# College_Social_Network_Analysis
This project focuses on studying the social network of two academic instituions (Illinois Institute of Technology vs Northwestern University)
and comparing it to the real networks.
Additionally a sentiment analysis is performed on the tweets posted by the university twitter users, to analyse trending topics at each university,
and to classify a random tweet into one of the five trending topics using Logistic Regression. 
This repository contains python scripts used to collect and process twitter data collected for each University.
The script Project.ipynb is the main script that can be run to display the final results and see the graphs.
